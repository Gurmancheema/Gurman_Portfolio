# Project 1: Car sales predcitor: Project overview

- Created a machine learning model to predict the resale value of cars using a dataset from Kaggle
- Explored and experimented with various regression algorithms, and found that the random forest regressor performed the best
- Performed data cleansing, feature engineering, and other operations to improve the accuracy of the model
- Built a client-facing API using Streamlit, which allows users to input car attributes and receive a predicted resale value in return.
- The project aimed to help people understand the value of their used cars and help car dealerships make better pricing decisions.
