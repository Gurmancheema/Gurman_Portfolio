# [Project 1: Car sales predictor: Project overview](https://github.com/Gurmancheema/Car-Sales-Predictor-WebApp-using-Random-Forest-Regressor)

- Created a machine learning model to predict the resale value of cars using a dataset from Kaggle
- Explored and experimented with various regression algorithms, and found that the random forest regressor performed the best
- Performed data cleansing, feature engineering, and other operations to improve the accuracy of the model
- Built a client-facing API using Streamlit, which allows users to input car attributes and receive a predicted resale value in return.
- The project aimed to help people understand the value of their used cars and help car dealerships make better pricing decisions.

# [Project 3: Boston House Price Prediction: Project overview](https://github.com/Gurmancheema/BostonHousePricing/tree/main)
- Performed data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records. Applied feature engineering techniques to derive new meaningful features.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between features.
- Utilized linear regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model for estimating house prices in Boston. Implemented the model using appropriate libraries and frameworks in Python.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots helped in understanding feature distributions, identifying correlations, and detecting potential outliers.
- Deployed the ML model and the Flask web application on the Heroku platform, making it accessible to users over the internet.
